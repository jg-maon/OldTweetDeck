Keep in mind that OldTweetDeck is generally not made to enhance TweetDeck, just to return it. All of TweetDeck's code is minified and it's very hard to add something into it. If you propose a new feature, there's a huge chance that it won't be added.
You might be interested in [BetterTweetDeck](https://github.com/dimdenGD/BetterTweetDeck), which is a project that focuses on improving TweetDeck. It also doesn't get new features except bug fixes, but if you haven't checked it yet, there's a chance it already has a feature you want.
